In this chapter, we will be using the MNIST dataset, which is 
aset of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school
students and employees of the US Census Bureau. 
Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. This set has
been studied so much that it is often called the “Hello World” of
Machine Learning: whenever people come up with a new 
classification algorithm, they are curious to see how it will 
perform on MNIST. Whenever someone learns Machine Learning, 
sooner or later they tackle MNIST.
