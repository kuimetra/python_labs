The way the application is created in the single-file
version is very convenient, but it has one big
drawback. Because the application is created in the
global scope, there is no way to apply configuration
changes dynamically: by the time the script is running,
the application instance has already been created, so
it is already too late to make configuration changes.
This is particularly important for unit tests because
sometimes it is necessary to run the application
under different configuration settings for better
test coverage.
